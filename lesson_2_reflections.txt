What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A: A Git repository is created empty for the files within the directory. We should check the status of the repository submit first commit asap.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Aï¼šThe staging area works as a buff area for user to confirm which documents to submit. When submitting, user has a chance to reconfirm the file to be submitted.
